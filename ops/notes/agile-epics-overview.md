# Epics

If you aren't familiar with Epic's, start by watching [this YouTube video][youtube-epic].

## What is an Epic?

A wrapper/container for the development of a project that provides a Solution, and focuses on
the aspects of the project that have the highest ROI (Return On Investment).

## Two Types of Epics

1. Business epics - deliver business value
2. Enable epics - improve systems to support future business or technical needs

## Technically we are NOT implementing an Epic

Technically the constraints of our assignment disqualify this from being an epic, for a few
reasons:

1. We are a temporary team.
2. We have a start and end date (probably).
3. Progress is measured by task completion, instead of how we benefit from this.
4. We aren't dealing with customers.

## What's the lifecycle of an Epic?

Epics, just like issues and user stories should progress through a Kanban, proceeding through
various states of maturity until they are approved or rejected.

In our case, our project manager should probably be able to read our epic, analyze our
application, and be able to determine if our application meets the qualifications put forth by
our epic.

## Epics have MVPs!

In other words, this solution is business oriented and should support real potential customers
to generate validated learning. What the heck does that mean? It means, that we should have a
way to learn from our customers.

So it's on us to seek out feedback. We need to seek out some people to use this app that are
willing to provide us feedback, and then we need to **actually** listen to them!

## Cost is important! How do we measure it?

- Does this app have any potential costs? (_Hopefully not, but that would be a good problem to
  have!_)
- How much time do we have, and how much is our time worth? We should know this.

### What's our budget?

We have approximately 133 hours of class time left.  
Roughly 36 of those hours are going to be used by our instructors.  
133h - 36h = 97h keyboard time.  
We can estimate that we will lose at least 10% of that time to other things.  
97h x 90% = 87.3h  
Each iteration of work should be 8 hours or less. (That's the industry standard!)  
87.3h of time / 8h iterations = ~11 units of work (user stories).

There are 4 of us in this group, which means we can complete 44 units of work (11 each) by the
end of the cohort.

**Total Hours** = 87.3h x 4 people = 349.2 person hours.

### How much do you guys think we are worth as developers?

The following table uses salary data reported by [PayScale](https://www.payscale.com/) to
estimate how much money we are spending to work on this project based on the lowest reported
developer salaries in our respective places of living.

| Developer | Location          | Salary (annual) | Hourly Wage | Cost Estimate (_wage x 87.3 hours of work_) |
|:----------|:------------------|:----------------|-------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Henry     | [Portland, OR][1] | $52,000         | $25.00      | $2,182.50                                   |
| Stephen   | [Provo, UT][2]    | $47,000         | $22.60      | $1,972.98                                   |
| Erik      | [New York, NY][3] | $65,000         | $31.25      | $2,728.13                                   |
