# Vacatio SLA's (Service Level Agreements)

- A person's account has a randomly generated ID attached to it.

- People who use Vacatio can be reasonably assurred that their account profiles are not
  searchable by people they are not friends with. (There are no search results for users; you
  have to enter account "hashes" exactly.)

- People are able to easily and securely add companions to their trip (e.g. click of button to
  share profile and add to trip).

- People should be able to block other people on Vacatio (e.g. slide option to block).

- The developers have the least amount of access to peoples account information as possible.
  When developers don't want access to an Account property, then that property value needs to
  be hashed before it is stored in a database (e.g. a person's phone number).

- It should be easy for Account owners to permanently delete their Vacatio account. It should
  be done in 4 button clicks or less. (More -> Account settings -> delete account -> Are You
  Sure?)

- Account owners own their data. When they delete their account, their account data is
  subsequently deleted from all of the applications databases.

- People must login in order to interact with key business logic.
